# Maze Contest

## Goal

This project is a multiplayer maze game where players upload their algorithms in JavaScript files. The server executes these algorithms to navigate through the randomly generated maze.

It's a simple project quickly create (with my friends ChatGPT and Github Copilot ) to introduce middle and high school students to web development, algorithms and cybersecurity.

First the students play the game by writing some algorithms and then they try to find security vulnerabilities in the app, enumerate them, and exploit the critical ones.

## Usage

1. Open the client application in your browser.
2. Upload your JavaScript algorithm file to be listed as a player.
3. Train on dedicated page or ask an admin to launch a game.
4. View the results in the UI.

## Installation

### Server
1. Navigate to the server directory.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `npm start`

### Client
1. Navigate to the client directory.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the client: `npm start`


## Exercises to go further

1. Learn the basics of __react__ and understand the app code
2. The app is only in english add french by internationalizing it with __i18n__
3. Learn the other search algorithms and complete the __maze.js__ file
4. Fix the vulnerabilities found
5. Clean the code and make a prettier app
